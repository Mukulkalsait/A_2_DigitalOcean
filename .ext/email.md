Hi Muskan,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, I wasn’t able to access the required credits on time on digitalOcean Platform, which caused a short delay.

I have now completed the task and documented everything clearly.

**Video walkthrough (with full explanation):**
👉 YouTube: <YOUTUBE_LINK>

**GitHub repository:**
👉 https://github.com/Mukulkalsait/A_2_DigitalOcean/tree/main

The GitHub repository contains:

* All configuration files used in the setup
* A complete **README.md** with step-by-step documentation
* Commands, explanations, and structure followed during the setup

The documentation is available in the README.md file in the repository.
For convenience, I’ve also included it here again, and some screenshots are attached below for quick reference.

The LXD container is currently **running and accessible**.
You can verify it using the following IP address:
👉 <PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>

Please let me know if you’d like any changes, additional explanations, or a live walkthrough.

Thanks & regards,
Mukul
